	  <p>I'm a constantly curious person who always says "yes" to new adventures.</p>
      <p>I've worked in a variety of industries, and am comfortable with getting outside
	  my comfort zone in order to learn new things. I play harmonica and classical guitar,
	  I've learned to dance salsa and scuba dive, I've made almost 3,000 skydives and a 
	  few hang glider flights... <br><br>and in addition to learning HTML, CSS, and Python...
	  <br>...I'm fluent in Spanish =]<br><br>I've chosen a career in programming because
	  I like building things. It feels like a puzzle, a game. This is good news for potential
	  employers... because I <strong>master my passions.</strong></p>

It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles,
 or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the <strong>man who
 is actually in the arena,</strong> whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood... who at the best 
 knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, <strong>at 
 least fails while daring greatly,</strong> so that his place shall never be with those cold and 
 timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.
</blockquote>
